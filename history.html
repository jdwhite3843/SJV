            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
            <blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>
            <article>
                
                <p>It is with regret that San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is postponing our final two lectures: Dr. Paul Hessberg, “How Do You Want Your Smoke” and Jane Pauley, “Sunday Morning on Wednesday.”
                <br />
                The San Joaquin Valley Town Hall Board has no choice but to postpone these lecture due to CDC instructions and the City of Fresno closing the Convention Center and Saroyan Theatre due to the COVID-19 virus.
                <br />
                The health and welfare of our audience is our primary concern, and the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus has made this decision imperative. We will do our best to reschedule both lectures once it is safe to do so. Your existing Dr. Paul Hessberg and Jane Pauley lecture tickets will be honored on the rescheduled dates.
                <br />
                Thank you for your understanding,
                <br />
                San Joaquin Valley Town Hall Board of Directors
